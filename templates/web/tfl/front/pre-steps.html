<p style="max-width: 38em; font-size: 1.2em;"><b>While we find ourselves in these unprecedented times.</b> All issues reported on Streetcare
    will continue to be actioned to keep our roads safe for critical workers to continue to
    support London. We may take longer to respond to you while we concentrate on getting
    issues resolved as our priority. Non-urgent defects may also take longer than normal
    to fix. We will continue to serve you the best that we can but urge everyone not to
    make journeys unless absolutely necessary.
